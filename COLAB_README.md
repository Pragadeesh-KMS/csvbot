# Python Code for CSV Data Analysis and Q&A using Langchain and OpenAI

This repository contains Python code for analyzing CSV data and answering questions related to the data using the Langchain library and the OpenAI API.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and use this code:

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive use) or Gooogle colab

- [![Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16tCivijJ2n6xqwuyYnv3_lIeybGJeCTX?usp=sharing)

### Installation

1. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip -q install langchain openai
   import os
   ```
   
   ```bash
   import pandas as pd
   ```
   
   ```bash
   from langchain.agents import create_csv_agent
   from langchain.llms import OpenAI
   ```
1. Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Usage

1. Upload your CSV data files, `firstfile.csv` and `secondfile.csv`, using Google Colab's file upload feature.


3. Run the code to load the CSV data into Pandas DataFrames:

   ```python
   df1 = pd.read_csv('firstfile.csv')
   df2 = pd.read_csv('secondfile.csv')
   ```

4. You can then interactively query the data by entering questions related to the CSV files:

   ```python
   user_input = input("Enter question: ")
   response_from_agent0 = agents[0].run(user_input)
   response_from_agent1 = agents[1].run(user_input)
   ```

5. The code will provide answers from both CSV files, and if a question is found in both files, it will combine the responses.

### Code Snippets

- The code includes snippets for setting up Langchain and the OpenAI API.
- It demonstrates how to load CSV data into Pandas DataFrames.
- It shows how to interactively query the data using Langchain agents.
